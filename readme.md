# Vernacular Mahābhārata

The `orig` directory contains Arlo's original data (which dates from august 2009).

Within this dir, `Text_Files_(UR)` (in IAST) is generated from
`Text_Files_(Malten)` (in SLP1 or sth) and is newer by a week. The date of
`Text_files_problems` is unknown. We assume the IAST data is up-to-date and
ignore the original data. We don't have access to the original converter.
Apparently, there are transliteration problems.
