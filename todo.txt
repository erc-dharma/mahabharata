# Transliteration

In ISO, there are still passages that are not transliterated. Malten's original is in some variant of the Harvard-Kyoto scheme, see
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2020/web/webtc/help.html.

Remains to translit bh9 in MBO-10(4):

	bolanti bh9 byāse ẏebe karibā pratikāre

Also beware of digits within text, which sometimes represent diacritics:

	āgeṇa mahāmatta ye pān1cha lakṣa gaja
	jaya1 tu jaẏa tu deba āhāre mattabhoḷā
	piṇḍāre basi uccāranti bubhmakṣita yajamāna kāṇḍi9 | 69 |

	arjuna boile deba tahiṁki9 na kariba cintā

	mūlya : ga4. 40 pa. (chāriṭaṅkā chāḷiśa paisā)
	bābu athabā saṁsāre3 se para upakārī

Also beware of English passages, which are transliterated but should not:

	iso/MBO-01(1).txt:<P1>{@ā plate or platles formed by leaves tacked together@}
	iso/MBO-02(1).txt:<P1>75|2 tumba :– {@1.  ṭhe cogged vhell belonging to a vater vheel. 2. ṭhe nave of a vheel. 3. ādam across a river.@}
	iso/MBO-06.txt-<P>ā stringed musical instr̥ment
	iso/MBO-06.txt:<>vith made the bottlegourd.

After all that is done, take care of vowels that should be capitalized or not
(see issues).

# Typing errors requiring attention

 ḍh is often (always?) mirepresented as t
 r̥ is often conflated with ru
 postconsonantal u is often misread as ma
 ā is often misread as a
 cā is mistyped as chā


# Structure

[MBO-01(2)-3]
[MBO-11(2)-title3]

	occurs before each new page; means vol. 1 part 2, p. 3 and so on

<H>	heading: bigger font, bold and center. no distinction
	between headings levels

Headings can have cont. lines, as in:

	<H>{@sāraḷā mahābhārata
	<>gāndhārīṅka netra jaḷare durddakṣara dahana@}

{@...@} is supposed to mark a single sentence apparently, so we should
keep it when possible, but it's not used consistently and I do not see the
difference with the use of <> for continuation lines.


<P>	single line in text body
<P1>	footnote, first line
<>	line break, cont. of prev line (in part. in fn)
