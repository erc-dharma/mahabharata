# Transliteration

In ISO, there are still passages that are not transliterated. Malten's original is in some variant of the Harvard-Kyoto scheme, see
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2020/web/webtc/help.html.
I propose the following replacements:

	s,A,ā,g
	s,I,ī,g
	s,U,ū,g
	s,E,e,g
	s,O,o,g
	s,M,ṁ,g
	s,K,k,g
	s,G,ṅ,g
	s,T,ṭ,g
	s,D,ḍ,g
	s,N,ṇ,g
	s,P,p,g
	s,B,b,g
	s,Y,y,g
	s,z,ś,g
	s,Z,ś,g
	s,S,ṣ,g
	s,L,ḷ,g

Not sure about:

	J
	C
	Q
	q
	f

Also beware of digits within text, which sometimes represent diacritics, e.g.

	Anay1ana o rAjasUy1a

Also beware of English passages, which are transliterated but should not, e.g.:

	ṭhe cogged vhell belonging to a vater vheel.

After all that is done, take care of vowels that should be capitalized or not
(see issues).


# Structure

[MBO-01(2)-3]
[MBO-11(2)-title3]

	occurs before each new page; means vol. 1 part 2, p. 3 and so on

<H>	heading: bigger font, bold and center. no distinction
	between headings levels

Headings can have cont. lines, as in:

	<H>{@sāraḷā mahābhārata
	<>gāndhārīṅka netra jaḷare durddakṣara dahana@}

{@...@} is supposed to mark a single sentence apparently, so we should
keep it when possible, but it's not used consistently and I do not see the
difference with the use of <> for continuation lines.


<P>	single line in text body
<P1>	footnote, first line
<>	line break, cont. of prev line (in part. in fn)
