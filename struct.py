"""
[MBO-01(1)-1] before each new page; some MBO stuff are transliterated;
we also have some parts of the text still in SLP1.

<H>	heading: bigger font, bold and center

	Headings can have cont. lines, as in:

		<H>{@sāraḷā mahābhārata
		<>gāndhārīṅka netra jaḷare durddakṣara dahana@}

	{@...@} is supposed to mark a single sentence, so we should keep it when
	possible, but it's not used consistently and I do not see the difference
	with the use of <> for continuation lines.


<P>	single line in text body
<P1>	footnote, first line
<>	line break, cont. of prev line (in part. in fn)
